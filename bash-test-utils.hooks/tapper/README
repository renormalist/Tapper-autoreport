This is an example hooks directory to extend bash-test-utils with some
Tapper behaviour, similar to what tapper-autoreport provides. This
subdir is completely optional. Feel free to write your own extensions
and ask for more hooks.

Activate the hooks by setting the hooks subdirectory before including
the bash-test-utils:

  export TESTUTIL_HOOKS=tapper
  . ./bash-test-utils

This will then look into ./bash-test-utils.hooks/tapper/* files and
include them if existing.

The files are named after the place where they are called. Following
hooks can be used:

 * functions

     Included after all functions are declared. Use it to declare
     additional functions or patch existing ones.


 * prepare_information

     Included at the end of the prepare_information() function. Use it
     to gather additional meta information.

 * suite_meta

     Included at the end of suite_meta() function. Use it to print out
     additional meta information.
